Fluffyâ€™s Sweet Treats was started by Marcelle Reid in 2016. She operates in Kingston, Jamaica, and primarily specialises in cakes for her clients. Currently, she utilises multiple devices to keep track of her orders; such as her phone for confirmation of deposits and ingredients currently in stock, and Microsoft Excel for specific requirements and prices for an order. She expressed that a system that would allow her to have all details in one place would be best suited for her business. 
The owner will be the primary user of the system. However, she may rarely have an assistant engage with it if necessary. Firstly, the user shall be able to view orders in the system, from which they may then choose to create, edit, or delete an order. These orders may be sorted by customer, due date, payment status, or date created. Additionally, the user shall also be able to view customers in the system, after which they may sort them by name. Finally, the user shall be able to view inventory in the system, and create, edit or delete new inventory records. The user may also sort these records by name, quantity, or status.
